[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/samvera-labs/ramp.svg?style=svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/samvera-labs/ramp)

A ReactJS component library of interactive components created to display audio/video resources in [IIIF Presentation 3.0 manifests](http://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/). These components are designed and built with reusability, customizability, and accessibility in mind.

#### **This is the renamed NPM component library previously known as [`@samvera/iiif-react-media-player`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@samvera/iiif-react-media-player)**

## Documentation

For full documentation of the component library, visit [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/samvera-labs/ramp/wiki)

Demo site built show-casing all the components at https://ramp.avalonmediasystem.org/

## Installation Guide:

### Prerequisites

Please ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (>= 16.x)
- `react` and `react-dom` (>= 17.x)
- NPM or Yarn

Only v3.3.0 or later versions, has support for React 18. For prior `@samvera/ramp` versions, please use React 17.

**Important**: `v3.3.0` can still be used with React 17. However, if you choose to upgrade to React 18; `react` and `react-dom` both need to be updated simultaneously to the same version.

To upgrade ReactJS in your application, please follow the instruction on the [ReactJS' official upgrade guide](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide#updates-to-client-rendering-apis).

### Steps

1. Add `@samvera/ramp` components library from NPM into your application"
```
// Using yarn
yarn add @samvera/ramp

// Using NPM
npm install @samvera/ramp
```
2. Add peer dependency for `Video.js` library:

```
// Using yarn
yarn add video.js@8.10.0

// Using NPM
npm install video.js@8.10.0
```
**Important**: *`@samvera/ramp <= v3.1.2`* needs `video.js@7.21.3`, because the included version of `@silvermine/videojs-quality-selector` is incompatible with `video.js >= v8.0.0`.

3. Import the library and `Video.js` into your application:
```
import { IIIFPlayer, MediaPlayer, StructuredNavigation, Transcript } from "@samvera/ramp";
import 'video.js/dist/video-js.css';

// Import starter styles 
import "@samvera/ramp/dist/ramp.css";
```

4. Example use of the components from the component library:

```
const App = () => {
  // Get your manifest from somewhere
  const manifestUrl = "https://some-manifest-url-here.json";

  // Transcript props
  const props = {
    playerID: 'player-id',
    transcripts: [
      {
        canvasId: 0,
        items: [ { title: "Title", url: "https://some-transcript-url-here.json" } ]
      }
    ]
  }

  return (
    <IIIFPlayer manifestUrl={manifestUrl}>
      <MediaPlayer enableFileDownload={false} />
      <StructuredNavigation />
      <Transcript {...props} />
    </IIIFPlayer>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Development

Ramp provides two development environments, 
- using [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/): a documentation site for all the components and their usage accompanied with code snippets, running on http://localhost:6060.
- using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/): show-case of how these components can be arranged on a web page and styled according to user preference, running on http://localhost:3003.

Both of these can run on your localhost at the same time, and can live-reload based on your code changes.

### Styleguidist environment

[React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/), in addition to providing documentation, also offers an isolated development environment. To start the dev environment, run:

```
yarn dev
```

To build a static html version of the docs (which Github pages uses), run:

```
yarn styleguide:build
```

This will create a set of static documentation HTML files in the project's `/docs` directory. In this documentation, each component is explained with a code sample and a description of its props and functionality.


### Webpack environment

An example usage of all the components in the library is served from the `/demo` directory. This showcases the real-time usage of the components in an application. To start this example, run:

```
yarn demo
```

## Testing

Ramp uses [`Jest`](https://jestjs.io/) and [`react-testing-library`](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) to build an automated unit test suite. To run these tests, with a full coverage report, run:

```
yarn test
```

To run tests in `watch` mode:

```
yarn test:watch
```

## Deployment

When new code is added into the `main` branch of the GitHub repo, it is deployed into two locations.


### Deploying to Netlify demo site

The [demo site](https://ramp.avalonmediasystem.org/) is hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), which displays all the components in the library in a similar manner to real-life usage of them.

This demo instance can read a **publicly available IIIF Presentation 3.0 Manifest** given the URL of the manifest and display content in the manifest.

A new build is triggered and published in Netlify when code changes are merged to `main` branch in this repository.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

The GitHub pages site, https://samvera-labs.github.io/ramp/ is built using ReactJS Styleguidist docs.

Similar to the demo site, a new build of this site it triggered and published when new code changes are merged to `main` branch.
