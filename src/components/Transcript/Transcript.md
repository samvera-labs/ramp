Transcript component displays any available transcript data in a given IIIF manifest. This component is detached from the Context providers that provides state management, therefore it requires a set of props to respond to the events fired by other components.

`Transcript` component **requires** the following props;

- `playerID`: to enable transcript synchronization with playback for timed-text.

   **Important**: _When using with a different media player (not the IIIFPlayer), the player should have a `dataset` property called, `data-canvasindex` (starts with 0) which points to the current canvas rendered from the IIIF manfiest._
- `manifestUrl`: URL of the Manifest used with the player pointed by the `playerID` prop. `Supplementing` annotations within the Manifest for each Canvas are parsed into a list of transcripts by the component. 
- `transcripts`: transcript related data as an array of JSON objects for each Canvas in the Manifest with the following props;

   - `canvasId`: to identify transcript data associated with each Canvas in a multi-canvas IIIF Manifest used in the media player, transcript data is grouped by `canvasId` in the props
   - `items`: list of objects with `title` and `url` props for transcript data files. The `url` prop can point to any of the following file types;

     - IIIF Manifest
       - As a list of `supplementing` annotations
       - As an external resource linked through `annotations` property with `supplementing` motivation
     - Word document (.docx)
     - Plain text file
     - WebVTT
    
    `transcripts` prop has a default value of an empty array.

     **_Identifying machine generated transcripts_**: To identify machine generated transcripts the Transcript component checks for `(Machine generated/machine-generated)` text disregarding case-sensitivity in the given title in the props or in the label in the `annotations`. 

__Either `manifestUrl` or `transcripts` is REQUIRED. If both props are given then `transcripts` takes *precedence* over `manifestUrl`__

To import this component from the library;
```js static
import { Transcript } from '@samvera/ramp';
```

```jsx inside Markdown
import config from '../../../env.js';

<Transcript
  playerID="iiif-media-player"
  transcripts={[
    {
      canvasId: 0,
      items: [
        {
