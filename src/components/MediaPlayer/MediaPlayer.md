MediaPlayer component provides a player that facilitates both audio and video media files in a IIIF Manifest. It encapsulates a [VideoJS](https://videojs.com/), which is an HTML5 player framework. `MediaPlayer` component fetches data from central state management system using Context providers. Therefore this component must *always* be wrapped by `IIIFPlayer` component.

`MediaPlayer` component accepts the following props;

- `enableFileDownload` : accepts a Boolean value, which has a default value of `false` and is _not required_. Once this is set to `true` it adds an icon to the player's control bar to display `rendering` files in the Canvas and enables downloading them. This is a custom VideoJS component added to the VideoJS instance in Ramp.
- `enablePIP` : accepts a Boolean value, which has a default value of `false` and is _not required_. When this is set to `true`, it adds an icon to the player's control bar to enable Picture-In-Picture feature for the current player. This icon is a VideoJS component.
- `enablePlaybackRate`: accepts a Boolean value, which has a default value of `false` and is _not required_. When this is set to `true`, it adds an icon to the player's control bar which provides a menu to select a different playback speed for the media. The available speed options are 0.5x, 0.75x, 1x, 1.5x, and 2x. This icon is a VideoJS component.
- `enableTitleLink`: accepts a Boolean value, which has a default value of `false` and is _not required_. When this is set to `true`, it adds a title bar to the video player which displays `Manifest Label - Active Canvas Label` with an href attribute linking to the URL in the active canvas's `id`. This is a custom VideoJS component added to the VideoJS instance in Ramp.
- `withCredentials`: accepts a Boolean value, which has a default value of `false` and is _not required_. Once this is set to `true` it causes the VideoJS component to include any available `Authentication` and `Cookie` headers with [XHR requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/withCredentials). There are special server-side CORS requirements that go along with this option – specifically, the streaming server should include an appropriate [`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Credentials) header, and a non-wildcard [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) specifying the server originating the request.
- `language`: accepts a String value for a [standard language code](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry), which has a default value of `en` and is _not required_. If the given language code doesn't match with any of the existing language file with `.json` extension, Ramp defaults to English language.

To import and use this component from the library;

import manifest from 'lunchroom_manners.js';

<IIIFPlayer manifest={manifest}>
  <MediaPlayer enableFileDownload={true} />
</IIIFPlayer>;
```
